## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The system follows a **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)** approach:

1.  **Client Layer**: Angular SPA serving as the presentation layer, consuming REST APIs and listening to WebSocket channels.
2.  **API Layer**: Laravel REST API handling business logic, validation, and persistence.
3.  **Real-time Layer**: Laravel Reverb server broadcasting events (Messages, Presence, Typing) directly to clients.
4.  **Data Layer**: PostgreSQL storing relational data (Users, Conversations, Messages, Attachments).
