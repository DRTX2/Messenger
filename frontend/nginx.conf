    # Proxy API requests to backend if needed, or assume backend is on a different port/host accessed directly by client.
    # Since Angular typically calls the full URL or a relative path if proxied.
    # Here we assume the frontend calls the backend URL directly (API_URL in environment), 
    # but for Docker to work well, usually we either configure CORS or proxy.
    # Given the user setup, let's keep it simple. If they need proxying:
    # location /api/ {
    #     proxy_pass http://backend:80/api/;
    # }
}
